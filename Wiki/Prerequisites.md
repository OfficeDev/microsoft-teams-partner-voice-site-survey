Ensure the administrator who will install the app has access to following:

#### SharePoint Administrator role
- Permission to upload application package into SharePoint Online
- Ability to create a site in SharePoint Online
- PartnerVoiceSiteSurvey project in GitHub

Once the package has been deployed, and solution synced to Teams, the same admin will likely also be asked to complete the first run experience. This first run creates the SharePoint site (PVSS) that all assets of this solution will be created under. ***Additionally permissions need to be modified by an owner of this site to include edit/contribute rights for the organizations ability to interact with the solution.***
